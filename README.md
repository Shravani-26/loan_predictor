# loan_predictor

This project focuses on predicting loan application approval status using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes features like applicant income, credit history, and employment status. Key steps include:


Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified trends and relationships in the dataset, such as credit history's impact on approval.


Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, normalized numerical features, and encoded categorical variables.


Modeling: Built and evaluated multiple classification models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.


Evaluation: Assessed model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to identify the most effective approach.
